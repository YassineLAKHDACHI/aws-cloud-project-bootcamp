## Creating my AWS Account && Set up an IAM user:
To create an AWS account, follow these steps:

 Then I set up an **IAM user** to execute all my tasks. I even added Multi-Factor Authentication to enhance security, which I learned about in [**Ashish's Week 0 - Security Considerations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EMWBYVggQI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=15). 
 Here are short instructions to create an IAM user associated with your AWS account:
+ Log in to the AWS Management Console and go to the IAM dashboard.
+ Click "Users" and then "Add user".
+ Enter a user name, select "Programmatic access", and click "Next: Permissions".
+ Choose the appropriate permissions and click "Next: Tags" and "Next: Review".
+ Review the user's settings and click "Create user".
+ Download and securely store the user's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
